# Foreign Fortran

> Invoke a Fortran shared library from other languages

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/foreign-fortran/badge/?version=latest)](https://foreign-fortran.readthedocs.io)

This is a Sphinx project (i.e. documentation focused rather than code
focused). The goal is to explain different scenarios where a Fortran
shared library can be called from other programming languages.
See [documentation][1] for examples in action.
